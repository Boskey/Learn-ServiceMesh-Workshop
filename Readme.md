# Learn Service Mesh Workshop #
This is a Lab guide to the Service Mesh Workshop being conducted in Kubecon, NA, 2018. The labs are self-explanatory and can be taken on their own, with a Kubernetes cluster on any Cloud. If walking through the labs outside of the workshop, knowledge on Kubernetes Service, Service Mesh and Istio will help.
