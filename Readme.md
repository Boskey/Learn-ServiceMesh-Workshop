# Learn Service Mesh Workshop #
This is a Lab guide to the Service Mesh Workshop being conducted in Kubecon, NA, 2018. The labs are self-explanatory and can be taken on their own, with a Kubernetes cluster on any Cloud. If walking through the labs outside of the workshop, knowledge on Kubernetes Service, Service Mesh and Istio will help.

# Lab1: Getting connected to your Kubernetes Cluster
# Lab2: Deploying a Micro Service based Application
# Lab3: Installing Istio on Kubernetes Cluster
# Lab4: Configuring Istio for the application deployed in Lab2
# Lab5: Traffic management
# Lab6: Canary Upgrade of Application
# Lab7: Tracing Application with Jaeger
